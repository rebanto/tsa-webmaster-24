            At the Green Platter, we believe that food is a celebration of
            diversity, nature, and community. Our journey stems from a simple
            idea: sustainability. We began the Green Platter because we believed
            everybody deserves to have a chance to eat plant-based meals made
            with ingredients sourced directly from local farms, providing
            nutritious and sustainable meals to our customers. We believe
            sustenance is at risk, the choices we make to locally source
            ingredients for the meals we serve is a meaningful and profound step
            in the right path for preservation. At the Green Platter, whether
            you are just exploring plant-based cuisine, attempting to move
            towards more mindful eating, or are just a lifelong vegetarian, we
            invite you to taste our fresh and exquisite locally sourced cuisine
            and contribute to the betterment of the environment, one plate at a
            time.
